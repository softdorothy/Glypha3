It determines this by way of priorities.  If a sound channel is…// idle and playing no sound, its channel priority is 0.  Since the priority of…// the sound you want to play is assumed to be greater than 0, it will, without…// a doubt, be allowed to play on an idle channel.  If however there is already…// a sound playing (the channel's priority is not equal to 0), the sound with the…// largest priority wins.  Mind you though that there are two channels to choose…// between.  Therefore, the function compares the priority passed in with the…// sound channel with the lowest priority.void PlayExternalSound (short soundID, short priority){							// A little error-checking.	if ((soundID >= 0) && (soundID < kMaxSounds))	{		if (soundOn)		// More error-checking.		{					// Find channel with lowest priority.			if (externalPriority < externalPriority2)			{				// Compare priority with that of channel 1.				if (priority >= externalPriority)					PlaySound1(soundID, priority);			}			else			{				// Compare priority with that of channel 2.				if (priority >= externalPriority2)					PlaySound2(soundID, priority);			}		}	}}//--------------------------------------------------------  ExternalCallBack// Callback routine.
